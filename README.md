# Equilibrium

Equilibrium is a Minecraft mod based around balance changes and additions that make you feel your advancements are earned. Few things are sacred in the way of this mission.

## Installation

Download the recommended mod version for the Minecraft version you're playing from the packages section of this repository. Take it from your download directory and place it in the `mods` folder in `.minecraft`.

## Configuration

After running Minecraft with the mod installed, a config will be generated in the `config`  folder of your .minecraft root called `equilibrium-common.toml`.

This should permit you to enable or disable features at will.
